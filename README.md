# UserStudyNeedleStartPose

## Introduction
This repository contains a module for 3D Slicer (v5.2.2).
The purpose of this module is to create a platform for an academic user study 
simulating a surgical setup for the manual initial insertion of a multi-stage steerable needle robot 
conducting a liver biopsy. In practice, precision variability upon the initial insertion of a steerable needle 
robot substantially influences the probability of success for a surgical procedure, such as a biopsy, under motion 
planning constraints. To refine this technology for reliable usage in a real surgical environment, it's essential 
to gather data on user behavior with respect to the precision of the initial insertion and the potential for visual elements 
to alter such behavior. The purpose of the proposed study is to gather this data.
